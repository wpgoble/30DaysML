    Class that represents a decision node or leaf in the decision tree

    -----------
    feature_i: int
        Feature index which we want to use as the threshold measure.
    threshold: float
        The value that we will compare feature values at feature_i against to
        determine the prediction.
    value: float
        The class prediction if classification tree, or float value if regression tree.
    true_branch: DecisionNode
        Next decision node for samples where features value met the threshold.
    false_branch: DecisionNode
        Next decision node for samples where features value did not meet the threshold.
